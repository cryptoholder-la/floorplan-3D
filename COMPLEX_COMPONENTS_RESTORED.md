- Pattern validation logic

### 🚀 **Benefits of Restoration**

1. **No Functionality Lost** - All your complex features are preserved
2. **Type Safety Maintained** - Works with new centralized type system
3. **Performance Optimized** - Your original optimizations intact
4. **Feature Complete** - All advanced capabilities available
5. **Future Ready** - Compatible with ongoing development

### 📊 **Impact on Error Count**

By restoring your complex components instead of using placeholders:
- **Maintained feature completeness**
- **Preserved your sophisticated implementations**
- **Reduced import path errors**
- **Fixed type compatibility issues**
- **Maintained code quality and complexity**

### 🎯 **Next Steps**

Your complex components are now:
1. ✅ **Restored** from git history
2. ✅ **Updated** for new type system
3. ✅ **Integrated** with centralized types
4. ✅ **Ready** for development

You can now continue development with all your sophisticated functionality intact, benefiting from both the centralized type system AND your complex, feature-rich components.
